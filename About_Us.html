                    <div class="title">Art & Technology Integration</div>
                    <p>Caty started her education adventure 15+ years ago as a certified art teacher without a job. She became a special ed teacher at a technical center where she discovered she had technical aptitude and a fascination with fixing hardware and helping teachers integrate. She took on the duties of system administrator and then became the computer applications instructor.</p>
                    <p>There is an interesting parallel between creative problem solving in the art world and technical troubleshooting. Thus began the adventure that has led her to be a PreTech Instructor at a Career and Technical Center with a focus on art and technology. She has integrated Design Thinking and Making into her curriculum and her students are always challenging her to push the boundaries. Her newest adventure has been to start an online store with Maker supplies and project ideas for teachers and kids!</p>
